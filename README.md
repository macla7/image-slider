# project-template

Got Basic webpack, ESLint and Prettier set up.

To fix prettier not formatting on initialisation error. I enabled it off and on again in the VSCode settings. AND, i added /node_modules to the prettierignore... one of these two seemed to work lol..

Had a heavy helping hand from this <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp'>w3schools</a> article.
